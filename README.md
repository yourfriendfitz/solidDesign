# SOLID Design Principles

This repository coincides with the Lynda.com course Learning S.O.L.I.D. Programming Principles

## What Could Go Wrong

Software is always in a state of flux
OO Languages allow for separation of concerns
SOLID shows separation techniques and ways to avoid ripple effects

Problems with blackjack sim:
Mixed responsibilities,
Missing responsibilities,

Poor constructor design,
Haphazard interface.

SOLID addresses software design issues

The SOLID principles give programmers a common framework for addressing specific kinds of design deficiencies.

S: Single responsibility, O: Open/closed, L: Liskov substitution, I: Interface segregation, and D: Dependency inversion.

DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)
GRASP (General responsibility assignment software principles)
TDD (Test-driven Development)

SOLID, DRY, GRASP, and TDD overlap in principle.

The SOLID principles will help a designer articulate why some designs are superior to others. These principles will say nothing about a large number of software engineering issues.

# Interface Segregation

a client should depend on the smallest set of interface features, the fewest methods and attributes. A class needs to be designed so that collaborators have the narrowest interface.
